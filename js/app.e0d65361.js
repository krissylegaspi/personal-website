That’s the beauty about Time. That’s the kindest quality about Time. That’s what we all need so very much. A Time to heal. And that Time can only come with time. How ironic! The past is the skeleton that Time left behind. The present is Time’s new avatar. The future is Time’s surety of reincarnation. But in all three forms of progression of Time’s soul, we are being taught the beautiful lesson of learning from our experiences, therefore, Healing.

We filmed dozens of shots outside where the burglar was hopping the fence and the superhero was chasing after him. Afterwards, we went inside to discuss the next scenes we were going to film. I was discussing details and suggestions for the next shot when, suddenly, my friend shushed me nervously. He was looking past behind me, his face turning white as he told us to be quiet. I didn&#39;t know why he was being like this but I started to get scared. I looked behind me and noticed a stranger outside the window has entered the gated fence. My friend told us to stay put while he starts walking towards the door to his backyard. When he stepped outside, the stranger shouted and I saw a gun pointed at him. It was a police officer. We could hear our friend, his voice cracking and filled with fear. We were confused and concerned. The police officer went inside and was yelling at us to put our hands in the air and to walk outside. As we walked, I saw a few more cops gathered, guns in their hands and pointed at us as we walked out. We saw our friend faced down on the ground with his arms on his side. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> My friend kept pleading, &quot;We&#39;re shooting a film;&quot; His camera still in his hands. We were forced to lay faced down and they handcuffed us. &quot;If you talk, we&#39;ll shoot,&quot; they threatened. Guns still pointed at us. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> They asked if there&#39;s anyone else inside. There was - my friend&#39;s grandmother who was sleeping upstairs and his cousin who is neurodivergent. More police officers went inside and started searching the house. My friend cried, &quot;Don&#39;t kill my grandmother.&quot; No response. We heard them kicking down doors and my friends and I looked at each other anxiously. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> They grabbed us from the ground and had us sit in front of a brick wall next to each other. The police officers conversing but I couldn&#39;t distinguish what they were talking about because my ears were ringing from how worried I was. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2>I saw more police officers coming in. There was probably about a dozen now. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> After a while, the police officers brought out my friend&#39;s cousin who was also handcuffed and sat him next to us. Finally, my friend&#39;s grandmother came out, assisted by a cop. She was in her pajamas, her face confused, and hair still messy from her nap. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> &quot;That&#39;s my grandson,&quot; she explained. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> My friend has been telling them that he lived here and that we were just shooting a film. And it was already proven by his grandmother. But they still didn&#39;t take off our handcuffs. They said they were waiting for their supervisor. While we were still sitting on the ground, they started asking us for our names and we gave it to them. Past the gates that the cops were entering and exiting from, I saw that there were multiple cop cars on the cul-de-sac. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> A man in regular clothes wearing a badge and sunglasses came through the gates. He asked my friend what happened here. My friend explained again that we were shooting a film. The man said his neighbor thought that there was a burglary at his house. The cops were called on my friend, whose lived at this house all his life. He told them again that we were just shooting a film. The man tells us that if we were shooting a film like this, we should have informed the police about it. I asked myself if that was really what we should have done, if that would have worked to prevent this from happening, and how they would verify that we&#39;re not actual burglars lying on the phone. We just nodded anyway. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> They started taking the handcuffs off of us while some started walking towards the gate they broke into. A cop asked my friend what kind of film we were shooting. He said we were shooting a film about a superhero saving the day. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> The cop smirked, &quot;Good thing the real superheroes came, huh?&quot; </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> The rest of the cops laughed. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> My friend cancelled the film. </p><p data-v-2f4735a2> We did nothing wrong.

I was very excited because I don&#39;t remember the last time I went snorkeling and I had just purchased new gear. The water was warm and it was awesome being in the water. </p><p data-v-8f614f5e> It wasn&#39;t that far away from the coast where the ocean floor starts to drop steeply. I think about 30 feet out in the ocean, I already couldn&#39;t touch the sandy floor with my feet. I don&#39;t float well but the flippers really helps me stay well above the water than I would have been able to without them. </p><p data-v-8f614f5e> I was excited and ready. My friends and I started snorkeling for longer periods of time. One of our friends was lagging behind because he was already getting tired. He told us to just keep going and to not wait for him. </p><p data-v-8f614f5e> I wanted to stay closer to the coast because I was afraid of going too deep and too far. Eventually, we started seeing rock formations underwater and I started to feel the waves getting stronger and stronger, pushing us away from our intended snorkeling path. I lifted my head out the water and looked around me. It was too late. We were next to the cliff. Little did I know that we were supposed to stay at a good distance from the cliffs because the waves can push us towards the big rocks. And they did. </p><p data-v-8f614f5e> We were stuck. The waves crashing onto the rocks were too big and too strong for us to swim away against the current. We were yelling to my friend who stayed behind to call a lifeguard. He was too far to be audible and it didn&#39;t seem like he understood us either but we kept screaming for help and trying to flail our arms out though we needed them to avoid getting slammed onto the rocks. I started drowning. I feel numb. Am I going to die? Suddenly, the waves knocked one of my flippers off my foot. I kept telling my friend that we&#39;ll be okay and to not let go of my hand. After what felt like the longest seconds of my life... </p><p data-v-8f614f5e> A lifeguard came. </p><p data-v-8f614f5e> He extended a surfboard that we can hold onto to help swim towards him because he couldn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t go to where we were. One by one, we made it out of the waves. He said this was normal... To me, that was crazy. How many other people experience this traumatizing event? </p><p data-v-8f614f5e> Finally, we were back to land. The lifeguard guided us towards his post and handed us antibiotics. Wait - for what? The waves that kept pushing us against the rocks caused giant scratches all over our bodies. I was bleeding. The adrenaline and the fight-or-flight triggers were too much that I did not feel being cut all over my body. </p><p data-v-8f614f5e> I&#39;m glad one of our friends stayed behind. I&#39;m glad we are alive. </p><p data-v-8f614f5e> I&#39;m not sure how much time actually passed while we were struggling.

I have been able to reflect on many things that has happened. I still continue to do so, but I have learned many, many things. It seems like time flew by really quickly when I think bout the occurrences. They feel like they happened ages ago. Even Trump&#39;s inauguration feels like ages ago but it&#39;s only been a little over a year. </p><p data-v-cae5f86e> As someone who encourages and embraces growth, these past months have proven to be the greatest leap of growth for myself. I allowed people to see who I am and push me to become a better version of myself. There were a lot of goodbyes, of hellos, and trying to figure out who I am. I made tons of mistakes, a lot of cringe-worthy decisions and moments that I would take back in a heartbeat. It is still hard to say or tell if I&#39;m grateful for everything, because of one decision that has stuck to my heart deeply--but despite the fact, I am content. I&#39;m grateful generally, regardless. </p><p data-v-cae5f86e> Shout out to Towee, for being the absolute greatest friend, making these past months bearable. To my big, Alex, for pushing me to keep my head up and for constantly being my cheerleader. To Sabrina, Jerimi, and Justin, for setting me straight when I&#39;m being unreasonable and for never failing to remind me that I&#39;m capable of anything as long as I put my mind to it. To my mom and my sister, for reminding me that if I ever need their undying support, that they&#39;ll be waiting for me at the nearest Filipino restaurant ready to listen. To kuya Neil, for giving me a reason to wake my ass up on 8 AM mornings and work (somewhat) hard. And to everyone else who pushed me, who put up with me despite my stubbornness, and for simply allowing me to be a part of your life; whether it was short-lived or not, you know who you are &amp; I&#39;m eternally grateful. </p><p data-v-cae5f86e> Thank you. </p><p data-v-cae5f86e> Xo, Kristine </p></div>',2);Object(n["r"])();var r=o((function(e,t,a,n,o,r){return i}))},"884f":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("399a")},8918:function(e,t,a){},"89e5":function(e,t){},"8b36":function(e,t){},"8c2e":function(e,t,a){},"8d23":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("010c")},"99e7":function(e,t,a){"use strict";a("fe9d")},"99f5":function(e,t,a){"use strict";var n=a("14a5"),o=a("e3ab");a("0ac4");o["default"].render=n["a"],o["default"].__scopeId="data-v-73f8d8f8",t["default"]=o["default"]},"9c36":function(e,t,a){},"9f5f":function(e,t){},a034:function(e,t,a){"use strict";a.d(t,"a",(function(){return r}));var n=a("7a23"),o=Object(n["G"])("data-v-efc69d76");Object(n["t"])("data-v-efc69d76");var i=Object(n["e"])('<div class="back" data-v-efc69d76><a href="javascript:history.back()" data-v-efc69d76><i class="fas fa-angle-double-left" data-v-efc69d76></i></a></div><div class="post" data-v-efc69d76><h2 data-v-efc69d76>Keep Warm and Stay Trendy</h2><h4 data-v-efc69d76>January 2016</h4><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yYUb4jIqIJY/V1SbUu8paYI/AAAAAAAAAVI/rtMrIWCeG_EEhpvDKXRf6EUvDvpWgJ5TACLcB/s1600/IMG_0035.JPG" data-v-efc69d76><p data-v-efc69d76> Revisiting places is one of the things I like to do because I get to see the changes since the last time I was there.
