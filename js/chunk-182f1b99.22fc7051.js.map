It might not be a big deal for many - but, for me, this was a step. I have been meaning to for a while now but I have always been one who had a hard time letting go of things, tangible or not. <p1>\"They're memories and they're fun to look at once in a while, why would you delete them?\"</p1> I know it's just social media, but there's a time and place for that. Winter quarter only served to be a distraction from what happened during winter break. The things that happened to me this spring break really opened my eyes and I've come to the conclusion that it is my long-awaited wake up call - the answer to my prayers. I believe it has been knocking on my door for the past few months but I have turned a blind eye and kept doing the same routines even though it was hurting me. Things were changing and I was scared.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            What do you do when you hurt someone? And if someone hurt you, how do you forgive that person? It's hard, isn't it. Most of the time, you can't take away the hurt caused because the other person is not willing to understand or forgive you. Sometimes it's hard because nothing you can ever do would really take away the hurt. What do you do then? As much as others have hurt me in many different ways in my life, I'm not afraid to admit that I have hurt others, too. That makes me human but surely it doesn't give me an excuse to continue doing so. We all hurt each other, intentionally or not, but we must always learn from lessons from each of our mistakes in life so that we do not cause the same kind of hurt again. When we do hurt someone, what's important is to realize that we were wrong. A lot of people go on to try and defend themselves even when they were the ones who caused the problem. I have done that, too. But later on I realized that I was wrong - and that realization is very important. We get carried away with our ego and pride that we don't want to admit we are wrong, even if we were truly wrong.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            They say it's easier to forgive than to forget. That's true. But I think if you genuinely feel Sorry and the other party can genuinely Forgive, then it's easier to forget, too. Why carry a load when you can take it off by saying Sorry and Forgiving each other? I know a couple of people who has been angry for years with each other over silly matters. It sounds absurd but it's true. Studies show that long-term baggage can lead to heart disease and other physical illnesses. Now, do we want that? No one wants that, so why put yourself through trauma like that? I know it's not that easy to say sorry or to forgive, it definitely takes a lot of love, but think about it - do you want to carry that kind of guilt/anger/hurt for so long even at the risk of your health? If you, or the other person die before you could reconcile, what have you achieved? Chances are the other person is hurt as much as you are, too. Everybody can be hurt.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Imagine carrying a heavy backpack on your back for life. How stressed you would be and how badly would that load affect your health, both in and out. By saying Sorry and Forgiving each other, trust me, you'd feel like that massive backpack is taken off your back. That helps your body and mind to relax. As a result, you'd be healthy too and so will the other person.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n            Ring up that friend you hadn't spoken for a long time even if she/he may be the one who has wronged. Send a \"I'm really sorry\" card to the person you hurt last week. Give a hug. If you don't get the chance at all to say sorry to or forgive that someone who's not alive anymore, say a little prayer and do something special in her/his memory today. Folks, say your dues today. The wait is a weight.\r\n        </p>\r\n    </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n\r\n.back {\r\n    max-width: 650px;\r\n    padding-top: 30px;\r\n    padding-bottom: 30px;\r\n    margin: auto;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.post {\r\n    max-width: 650px;\r\n    margin-left: auto;\r\n    margin-right: auto;\r\n    padding-bottom: 40px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.post h2 {\r\n    font-family: 'Homemade Apple', cursive;\r\n    margin: auto;\r\n    content: '';\r\n    box-sizing: border-box;\r\n    font-size: 30px;\r\n    word-spacing: 0.32em;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.post h4 {\r\n    border-bottom: 1px pink solid;\r\n    margin: auto;\r\n    opacity: 1;\r\n    font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;\r\n    opacity: 70%;\r\n    padding-bottom: 10px;\r\n}\r\n\r\nimg {\r\n    max-width: 100%;\r\n    padding-top: 10px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.post p {\r\n    padding-top: 10px;\r\n    text-align: justify;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.post p p1 {\r\n    font-style: italic;\r\n}\r\n\r\n</style>","import { render } from \"./TakeALoadOff.vue?vue&type=template&id=73f8d8f8&scoped=true\"\nimport script from \"./TakeALoadOff.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./TakeALoadOff.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./TakeALoadOff.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=73f8d8f8&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nscript.render = render\nscript.__scopeId = \"data-v-73f8d8f8\"\n\nexport default script","export { default } from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/index.js??ref--0-1!./TakeALoadOff.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/index.js??ref--0-1!./TakeALoadOff.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\""],"sourceRoot":""}
