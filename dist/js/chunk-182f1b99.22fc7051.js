"),c=Object(o["g"])("p",null," What do you do when you hurt someone? And if someone hurt you, how do you forgive that person? It's hard, isn't it. Most of the time, you can't take away the hurt caused because the other person is not willing to understand or forgive you. Sometimes it's hard because nothing you can ever do would really take away the hurt. What do you do then? As much as others have hurt me in many different ways in my life, I'm not afraid to admit that I have hurt others, too. That makes me human but surely it doesn't give me an excuse to continue doing so. We all hurt each other, intentionally or not, but we must always learn from lessons from each of our mistakes in life so that we do not cause the same kind of hurt again. When we do hurt someone, what's important is to realize that we were wrong. A lot of people go on to try and defend themselves even when they were the ones who caused the problem. I have done that, too. But later on I realized that I was wrong - and that realization is very important. We get carried away with our ego and pride that we don't want to admit we are wrong, even if we were truly wrong. ",-1),y=Object(o["g"])("p",null," They say it's easier to forgive than to forget. That's true. But I think if you genuinely feel Sorry and the other party can genuinely Forgive, then it's easier to forget, too. Why carry a load when you can take it off by saying Sorry and Forgiving each other? I know a couple of people who has been angry for years with each other over silly matters. It sounds absurd but it's true. Studies show that long-term baggage can lead to heart disease and other physical illnesses. Now, do we want that? No one wants that, so why put yourself through trauma like that? I know it's not that easy to say sorry or to forgive, it definitely takes a lot of love, but think about it - do you want to carry that kind of guilt/anger/hurt for so long even at the risk of your health? If you, or the other person die before you could reconcile, what have you achieved? Chances are the other person is hurt as much as you are, too. Everybody can be hurt.
