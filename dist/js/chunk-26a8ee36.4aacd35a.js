I have been able to reflect on many things that has happened. I still continue to do so, but I have learned many, many things. It seems like time flew by really quickly when I think bout the occurrences. They feel like they happened ages ago. Even Trump&#39;s inauguration feels like ages ago but it&#39;s only been a little over a year. </p><p data-v-cae5f86e> As someone who encourages and embraces growth, these past months have proven to be the greatest leap of growth for myself. I allowed people to see who I am and push me to become a better version of myself. There were a lot of goodbyes, of hellos, and trying to figure out who I am. I made tons of mistakes, a lot of cringe-worthy decisions and moments that I would take back in a heartbeat. It is still hard to say or tell if I&#39;m grateful for everything, because of one decision that has stuck to my heart deeply--but despite the fact, I am content. I&#39;m grateful generally, regardless. </p><p data-v-cae5f86e> Shout out to Towee, for being the absolute greatest friend, making these past months bearable. To my big, Alex, for pushing me to keep my head up and for constantly being my cheerleader. To Sabrina, Jerimi, and Justin, for setting me straight when I&#39;m being unreasonable and for never failing to remind me that I&#39;m capable of anything as long as I put my mind to it. To my mom and my sister, for reminding me that if I ever need their undying support, that they&#39;ll be waiting for me at the nearest Filipino restaurant ready to listen. To kuya Neil, for giving me a reason to wake my ass up on 8 AM mornings and work (somewhat) hard. And to everyone else who pushed me, who put up with me despite my stubbornness, and for simply allowing me to be a part of your life; whether it was short-lived or not, you know who you are &amp; I&#39;m eternally grateful. </p><p data-v-cae5f86e> Thank you. </p><p data-v-cae5f86e> Xo, Kristine </p></div>',2);Object(n["r"])();var s=o((function(e,a,t,n,o,s){return i}))},bea9:function(e,a){},e4c3:function(e,a,t){"use strict";t.r(a);var n=t("bea9"),o=t.n(n);for(var i in t.d(a,"default",(function(){return o.a})),n)["default"].indexOf(i)<0&&function(e){t.d(a,e,(function(){return n[e]}))}(i)}}]);
