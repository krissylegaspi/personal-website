        <h2>Villain</h2>
        <h4>May 2016</h4>
        <p>
            The cops were called on my friend's house while we were shooting a film about a superhero stopping a burglar. We filmed dozens of shots outside where the burglar was hopping the fence and the superhero was chasing after him. Afterwards, we went inside to discuss the next scenes we were going to film. I was discussing  details and suggestions for the next shot when, suddenly, my friend shushed me nervously. He was looking past behind me, his face turning white as he told us to be quiet. I didn't know why he was being like this but I started to get scared. I looked behind me and noticed a stranger outside the window has entered the gated fence. My friend told us to stay put while he starts walking towards the door to his backyard. When he stepped outside, the stranger shouted and I saw a gun pointed at him. It was a police officer. We could hear our friend, his voice cracking and filled with fear. We were confused and concerned. The police officer went inside and was yelling at us to put our hands in the air and to walk outside. As we walked, I saw a few more cops gathered, guns in their hands and pointed at us as we walked out. We saw our friend faced down on the ground with his arms on his side.
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend kept pleading, "We're shooting a film;" His camera still in his hands. We were forced to lay faced down and they handcuffed us. "If you talk, we'll shoot," they threatened. Guns still pointed at us.
        </p>
        <p>
            They asked if there's anyone else inside. There was - my friend's grandmother who was sleeping upstairs and his cousin who is neurodivergent. More police officers went inside and started searching the house. My friend cried, "Don't kill my grandmother." No response. We heard them kicking down doors and my friends and I looked at each other anxiously.
        </p>
        <p>
            They grabbed us from the ground and had us sit in front of a brick wall next to each other. The police officers conversing but I couldn't distinguish what they were talking about because my ears were ringing from how worried I was. 
        </p>
        <p>I saw more police officers coming in. There was probably about a dozen now.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a while, the police officers brought out my friend's cousin who was also handcuffed and sat him next to us. Finally, my friend's grandmother came out, assisted by a cop. She was in her pajamas, her face confused, and hair still messy from her nap.
        </p>
        <p>
            "That's my grandson," she explained. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend has been telling them that he lived here and that we were just shooting a film. And it was already proven by his grandmother. But they still didn't take off our handcuffs. They said they were waiting for their supervisor. While we were still sitting on the ground, they started asking us for our names and we gave it to them. Past the gates that the cops were entering and exiting from, I saw that there were multiple cop cars on the cul-de-sac.
        </p>
        <p>
            A man in regular clothes wearing a badge and sunglasses came through the gates. He asked my friend what happened here. My friend explained again that we were shooting a film. The man said his neighbor thought that there was a burglary at his house. The cops were called on my friend, whose lived at this house all his life. He told them again that we were just shooting a film. The man tells us that if we were shooting a film like this, we should have informed the police about it. I asked myself if that was really what we should have done, if that would have worked to prevent this from happening, and how they would verify that we're not actual burglars lying on the phone. We just nodded anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
            They started taking the handcuffs off of us while some started walking towards the gate they broke into. A cop asked my friend what kind of film we were shooting. He said we were shooting a film about a superhero saving the day. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The cop smirked, "Good thing the real superheroes came, huh?"
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest of the cops laughed.
        </p>
        <p>
            My friend cancelled the film.
        </p>
        <p>
            We did nothing wrong. But their unwelcomed arrival affected us in ways we didn't know at the time.
