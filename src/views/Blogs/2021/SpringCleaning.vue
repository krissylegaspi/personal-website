        <h2>Spring Cleaning</h2>
        <h4>March 2021</h4>
        <p>
            Spring has arrived and I am excited because this is my favorite season. I love watching the leaves grow back, the flowers bloom, and the warm sun kissing my skin. I am ready! A year has passed since the pandemic and a lot has changed.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also noticed that I write more during this season. I have a blog post during March of each year. Maybe it's because it's my favorite season. Or maybe that I take this opportunity to reflect. Longer days are ahead of us and this is the time to see how we have done so far since the beginning of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lately, I have been more motivated to work on more projects, apply to more jobs/internships, and to strive towards my career. I don't know why or how but I am excited.
