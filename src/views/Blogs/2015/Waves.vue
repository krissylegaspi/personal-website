        <p>
            My friends and I went to La Jolla Cove to go snorkeling. I was very excited because I don't remember the last time I went snorkeling and I had just purchased new gear. The water was warm and it was awesome being in the water.
        </p>
        <p>
            It wasn't that far away from the coast where the ocean floor starts to drop steeply. I think about 30 feet out in the ocean, I already couldn't touch the sandy floor with my feet. I don't float well but the flippers really helps me stay well above the water than I would have been able to without them.
        </p>
        <p>
            I was excited and ready. My friends and I started snorkeling for longer periods of time. One of our friends was lagging behind because he was already getting tired. He told us to just keep going and to not wait for him. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I wanted to stay closer to the coast because I was afraid of going too deep and too far. Eventually, we started seeing rock formations underwater and I started to feel the waves getting stronger and stronger, pushing us away from our intended snorkeling path. I lifted my head out the water and looked around me. It was too late. We were next to the cliff. Little did I know that we were supposed to stay at a good distance from the cliffs because the waves can push us towards the big rocks. And they did.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were stuck. The waves crashing onto the rocks were too big and too strong for us to swim away against the current. We were yelling to my friend who stayed behind to call a lifeguard. He was too far to be audible and it didn't seem like he understood us either but we kept screaming for help and trying to flail our arms out though we needed them to avoid getting slammed onto the rocks. I started drowning. I feel numb. Am I going to die? Suddenly, the waves knocked one of my flippers off my foot. I kept telling my friend that we'll be okay and to not let go of my hand. After what felt like the longest seconds of my life...
        </p>
        <p>
            A lifeguard came.
        </p>
        <p>
            He extended a surfboard that we can hold onto to help swim towards him because he couldn't and shouldn't go to where we were. One by one, we made it out of the waves. He said this was normal... To me, that was crazy. How many other people experience this traumatizing event? 
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, we were back to land. The lifeguard guided us towards his post and handed us antibiotics. Wait - for what? The waves that kept pushing us against the rocks caused giant scratches all over our bodies. I was bleeding. The adrenaline and the fight-or-flight triggers were too much that I did not feel being cut all over my body.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm glad one of our friends stayed behind. I'm glad we are alive.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm not sure how much time actually passed while we were struggling. But I felt like I aged a little during that moment.
